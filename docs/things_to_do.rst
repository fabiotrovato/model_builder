Things To Do and Keep in Mind
=============================

Things To Keep in Mind
----------------------

Our overall coding goals (in roughly decreasing importance):

1. Write code that is easy to understand and extend: style, design, and documentation.

  - Please force yourself to adhere to `PEP 8 style guide. <http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008>`_
  - Standardizing our coding style promotes readability. 
  - 20 useful adages: `Zen of Python <http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/>`_
  - Program design and development is nontrivial, ideally we would follow the 
    new school philosophy of `"agile development" <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development>`_
    where development process involves many small iterations. 
  - We should aim to add more features over time while simultaneously reducing our number of source code lines.

2. Write code that works: unit testing.
  - Code is broken until tested.

3. Eventually write code that is efficient with time and memory, but only after #1 & #2.
